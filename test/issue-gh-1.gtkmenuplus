#% Non-regression test for https://github.com/step-/gtkmenuplus/issues/1.

item = PASS if you see two submenus, 1 item, 2 submenus; all submenus include the leafpad launcher

configure = noendsubmenu
# Indent submenu items with \t; submenu ends at /^[^\t]/
submenu = submenu with leafpad
	launcher = /usr/share/applications/leafpad.desktop
	separator

submenu = submenu with leafpad
	item = # attempt work-around
	launcher = /usr/share/applications/leafpad.desktop
	separator

# The next directive matches /^[^\t]/ therefore it ends the current
# submenu when configure=noendsubmenu is in effect (default).
# Note that this is only necessary if you want to switch to using
# configure=endsubmenu in the middle of the script, like in this test.
