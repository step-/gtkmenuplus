#% Issue fixed in commit 12c2c0d.
#% After the fix this test should show all icons above the separator. Below the separator it should only show an icon for the first item (gtk-ok).

# Test the following (from ../docs/menu_configuration_file_format.txt)

# icon=path_to_image_file | icon_name | NULL

#   Optional.  Denotes a image to show with the menu item or submenu. 
  
#   Must be preceded by an "item=", or "submenu=" line, and possibly by an "icon=" and/or (if there's a preceding "item=" line) 
#   a "cmd=" line.  
  
#   It applies to the menu entry begun by the preceding "item=" line or submenu begun by the preceding "submenu=" line.

#   If a menu item lacks an icon line, or has an "icon=" line with nothing following the = sign, gtkmenuplus will attempt to 
#   find an icon associated with the executable named in the menu item's "cmd=" line; or, 
#   if the "cmd=" line specifies only a non-executable file, an attempt will be made to locate an icon associated
#   with the default programme used to open that file.

#   If you do not want an image on your menu item, use the line "icon=NULL", or:  

#     If the most recently encountered "configure=" line  in the menu configuration file included the word "noicons",
#     any item without an "icon=path_to_image_file" or "icon=icon_name" line will not be assigned an image.
