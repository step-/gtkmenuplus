SYNOPSIS
.LP
.EX
/path/to/script_file
.EE
.SS
DESCRIPTION
.LP
Gtkmenuplus interprets a script that defines the appearance and behavior
of a graphical popup menu. The script consists of directives read
from a text file, standard input (stdin), or command-line arguments.
.PP
This document describes the syntax and semantics of the scripting language.
For command invocation, refer to the gtkmenuplus(1) manual page.
.SS

    cmd = $command_
.EE
.SS
Directives
.LP
A directive consists of a reserved keyword optionally followed by a simple
or prefixed equal sign to separate optional arguments. The keyword may
be combined with an integer index, which is wrapped by square brackets.
.LP
.EX
    keyword         = arguments         # Most directives fall here
    keyword        ?= arguments
    keyword[index]  = arguments
    keyword
    keyword         =
    keyword[index]  =
.EE
.IP "\(bu" 3
White space around the syntactic units is optional.
.IP "\(bu" 3
Keywords are reserved words that ignore letter
case and consist only of alphanumeric characters.
.IP "\(bu" 3
The arguments can be empty, and their value may undergo built-in
textual transformations before the directive will consume them.

.SS
Parameters
.LP
The gtkmenuplus invocation and the [Include] directive can include
optional positional parameters following the script file. Other
directives can reference these internal parameters using a shell-like
syntax, such as \f(CR$1\fR, \f(CR$2\fR, etc. However, be wary that for the [Cmd]
and [Evaluated variable assignment] directives, the \f(CR$1\fR syntax refers
to the \fBshell\(cqs\fR actual positional parameter.
.SS
Parameter expansion
.LP
An undefined or empty parameter reference yields an empty string.
.PP
Referencing \f(CR$0\fR yields the following values:
.IP "\(bu" 3
\f(CR-\fR when the program is invoked with standard input redirection.
.IP "\(bu" 3
\f(CR$0\fR when invoked with command-line directives.
.IP "\(bu" 3
The pathname of the script file currently being read otherwise.
.LP
Parameter references can be used in other directives. First references are
expanded to form an expanded line. Then the containing directive is evaluated
on the expanded line.
.PP
Nested parameter references are not evaluated. For example, the
following shell command displays two menu items, \(lq$2\(rq and \(lqhello\(rq:
.LP
.EX
    gtkmenuplus 'item = $1; item = $2' '$2' hello
.EE
.SS
Testing empty parameters
.LP
The \f(CRif ?=\fR directive can be used to test if a parameter is empty.
Example:
.LP
.EX
    if ?= $1
    item = parameter 1 is not empty
    else
    item = parameter 1 is empty
    endif
.EE
.SS
Variables
.LP
.EX
    variable_name  = value          # Direct assignment
    variable_name == expression     # Assignment by output redirection
.EE
.SS
Direct assignment
.LP
Direct assignment associates the name of a variable with its value.
.PP
At the start of any line, a word followed by \f(CR=\fR that is not already
a directive keyword is treated as a \f(CRvariable_name\fR, provided that
it begins with an underscore or an alphabetic character, followed by
alphanumeric characters or underscores.
.PP
Interior white space in quoted \f(CRvalue\fR and \f(CRexpression\fR is preserved; other
white space on the line is ignored. To preserve all white space after \f(CR=\fR,
wrap the text with single or double quotes; they will be stripped before
storing the value or evaluating the expression.
.PP
If \f(CRvalue\fR starts with \f(CR=\fR, quote the value, e.g.,
.LP
.EX
    myvar_ =\(dq=  something nice \(dq
.EE
.PP
\fBInclude a underscore in the variable name to avoid conflicts:\fR
.IP "\(bu" 3
It is an error if \f(CRvariable_name\fR matches an existing environment
variable; no assignment occurs and a warning is printed to the console.
.IP "\(bu" 3
If \f(CRvariable_name\fR matches a directive keyword, the directive takes precedence.
.LP
Naming variables with a final underscore reduces the likelihood of matching
an environment variable and prevents clashes with future directive keywords.
.SS
Variable expansion
.LP
Other directives can reference the value of a variable using \f(CR$variable_name\fR
or \f(CR${variable_name}\fR. The value is made available from the first line after
the assignment. All references on the line are expanded by replacing each
reference with its literal value to create an expanded line. Then the directive
is evaluated passing the expanded value.
.PP
Referencing an undefined variable yields the original variable reference.
.PP
Variables have global scope. If the same \f(CRvariable_name\fR is re-assigned,
its value is globally redefined after the assignment. This holds true also
for variables that are assigned by an included file.
.PP
\(lq$\(rq cannot be escaped. To include a literal \(oq$\(cq, add a space it.
.SS
Evaluated variable assignment
.LP
The \(lq==\(rq assignment syntax evaluates the \f(CRexpression\fR as a shell command, and
saves standard output (stdout) as the variable value. However, if the command
exits non-zero, or the combined lengths of variable name and value exceed 1021
bytes, saving is prevented and the literal \f(CRexpression\fR is left unexpanded.
.PP
\fBThe evaluated assignment does not replace parameter references:\fR
.IP "\(bu" 3
References \f(CR$1\fR, \f(CR$2\fR, etc. are passed literally to
the underlying shell that expands the \f(CRexpression\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 3
You can use a gtkmenuplus parameter in an evaluated assignment via
an intermediate variable. For instance:
.LP
.EX
    Name_ = $1
    thisFile_ = $0
    Expression_ == set -- \(dqHello\(dq; echo \(dq$thisFile_: $1 $Name_\(dq
    item = $myExpression_
.EE
.IP
In the first assignment, \f(CR$1\fR expands to the first command-line argument.
Instead in the evaluated assignment \f(CR$1\fR is a shell parameter, previously
\f(CRset\fR to be \(lqHello\(rq, and then utilized by the \f(CRecho\fR command.
Save the example to file example.txt and run \f(CRgtkmenuplus example.txt Jane\fR
to display the menu item \(lqexample.txt: Hello Jane\(rq.
.LP
You can use an environment variable in an evaluated assignment this way:
.LP
.EX
        home1_ == printenv HOME
        home2_ == echo $HOME
.EE
.PP
The example sets \f(CRhome1_\fR and \f(CRhome2_\fR to your \f(CR$HOME\fR environment variable.
.PP
Utilizing relative pathnames with evaluated variables can be confusing.
Refer to the discussion in ยง [Directory prefix and the shell].
.SS
Variables are internal entities
.LP
Gtkmenuplus variables are internal program entities and not shell variables.
Consider the example below, which displays a menu item labeled \(lqhello\(rq:
.LP
.EX
    v1_ =  hello
    v2_ == v1_=world; echo $v1_
    item = $v2_
.EE
.PP
The shell receives as \fIinput\fR the string of commands \(lqv1_=world; echo hello\(rq.
You can insert \f(CRset -x;\fR after \f(CR==\fR to see the shell execution trace.
.SS
Testing for empty variables
.LP
Directive \f(CRif ?=\fR can be used to test if a defined internal variable is empty.
.LP
.EX
    if ?= $varname_
    item = varname_=$varname_
    else
    item = varname_ is empty
    endif
.EE
.SS
Pathname expansion
.LP
Pathname expansion pertains to \fIabsolute
pathnames\fR, which are defined as follows:
.IP "\(bu" 3
An \fIabsolute\fR pathname starts with \(lq/\(rq or \(lq\(ti/\(rq or \(lq./\(rq;
otherwise, it is considered \fIrelative\fR to a directory.
.LP
The directives that accept pathnames as arguments
undergo pathname expansion as defined below:
.IP "1." 3
\fBLeading tilde (\f(CB\(ti\fB) or dot (\f(CB.\fB) replacement\fR:
.RS
.IP "\(bu" 3
\(lq\(ti\(rq followed by nothing or \(lq/\(rq expands to the value of the
\f(CRHOME\fR environment variable followed by \(lq/\(rq.
.IP "\(bu" 3
\(lq.\(rq followed by nothing or \(lq./\(rq expands to the
\(lqcurrent \fIbase directory\fR value followed by \(lq/\(rq.
.IP "\(bu" 3
Expansion applies when the pattern immediately follows the \f(CR=\fR sign,
or a space, tab, single/double quote character, or the \(oq:\(cq separator in
a list of pathnames.
.IP "\(bu" 3
Write \(lq\f(CR\(ti\e/\fR\(rq to obtain a literal \(lq\(ti/\(rq, and \(lq\f(CR.\e/\fR\(rq for a literal \(lq./\(rq.
.RE
.IP "2." 3
\fBRelative to absolute pathname conversion\fR:
.RS
.IP "\(bu" 3
The \fIdirectory prefix\fR is determined based on the context:
.RS
.IP "\(bu" 3
For a script file specified on the command line,
the \fIdirectory prefix\fR is the \fIbase directory\fR of
the initial script file, where the file is located.
.IP "\(bu" 3
For stdin (\(lq-\(rq) or a list of command-line directives as the script,
the \fIdirectory prefix\fR is the \fIprogram\(cqs current directory\fR.[[bd1]]
.IP "\(bu" 3
Specific directives may also use a particular
\fIdirectory prefix\fR (see [Directory prefix exceptions]).
.RE
.RE
.IP "3." 3
\fBExpansion order:\fR
.RS
.IP "\(bu" 3
Pathname expansion takes place after
[Parameter expansion] and [Variable expansion].
.RE
.IP "4." 3
\fBCharacter limit\fR:
.RS
.IP "\(bu" 3
If pathname expansion results in a line longer than
1023 characters, expansion reverts and reports and error.
The message abbreviates the \fIdirectory prefix\fR as \(lq{}\(rq.
.RE
.SS
Directory prefix exceptions
.LP
When expanding a relative pathname, some directives first check for a
preset directory prefix. If such a prefix is set, it is used; otherwise,
the rules outlined in bullet 2 of ยง [Pathname expansion] are applied.

Directory prefix and the shell
.LP
The argument of a [Cmd] directive or an [Evaluated variable assignment] may
contain relative pathnames, which undergo [Pathname expansion] \fIbefore\fR being
passed to the shell (\f(CR/bin/sh\fR). Refer to the example in ยง [Pathnames and
shell execution].
.PP
If you find the example confusing, it is advisable to use absolute pathnames
in your shell command argument. For instance, start pathnames with \(lq/\(rq, or
prefix relative pathname with [Variables] whose values are the intended
directory prefixes.
.SS
MENU ENTRY
.SS
Menu entry properties
.LP
Gtkmenuplus displays a popup menu that consists of menu entries. Each
menu entry can either be a leaf node or a submenu container. Entries are
always visible unless an error in the script prevents their formation. A
leaf entry has four configurable properties: a label, an optional icon, an
optional tooltip, and an optional command that executes when the entry is
selected. If the command property value is empty, the entry is displayed
but cannot be selected. A submenu entry has three configurable properties:
a label, an optional icon, and an optional tooltip. Submenu entries are
always selectable, even if they do not contain any menu entries.
.SS
Directives for creating menu entries
.LP
A leaf menu entry corresponds to one of the following directives: [Absolute
pathname], [Relative pathname], [URI], [Item], or [Launcher]. The [Launcher]
directive may also represent a block of leaf entries. In contrast, a submenu
entry corresponds to either the [Submenu] or [Launchersubmenu] directives.
The [Launchersub] directive recursively scans directories, resulting in a
combination of multiple leaf and submenu entries.
.SS
ALL DIRECTIVES
.SS
Item
.LP
.EX
    item = label
.EE
.LP
The Item directive begins a new menu entry and concludes the scope of
a preceding [Item] directive.
.IP "\(bu" 3
The \f(CRlabel\fR argument sets the label property of the menu entry.
The label may be set to an empty string.
.IP "\(bu" 3
To select the entry with a key-press add a [Keyboard shortcut].
.IP "\(bu" 3
To obtain an indented label, use an intermediate variable as follows:
.LP
.EX
    label_ = \(dq    indent\(dq
    item   = $label_
.EE
.LP
You can place [Cmd], [Icon], and [Tooltip] directives in any order immediately
after the Item directive to set the properties of the menu entry. It is also
possible to conditionally set some properties using the [If] directive.
.SS
Keyboard shortcut
.LP
To create a keyboard shortcut (also known as an accelerator or \(lqmnemonic\(rq) for
a menu entry, include an underscore before a label character. This will allow
the corresponding key to select the menu entry. The command associated with the
menu entry is also activated if the selection is unambiguous. Only the first
occurrence of a single underscore in the label marks the shortcut key.
.PP
Refer to the [Format mnemonic] directive to set up automatic keyboard shortcuts.
.PP
When shortcuts are enabled, GTK transforms all single
occurrences of an underscore followed by a character into an
underlined character. To insert a literal underscore, you can:
.IP "\(bu" 3
Disable keyboard shortcuts using the [Configure]\f(CR=nomnemonic\fR option.
.IP "\(bu" 3
Enter two consecutive underscores, which will display as a
single literal underscore. Depending on the context, you may
need to double the number of underscores multiple times.
.SS
Cmd
.LP
.EX
    cmd = command
.EE
.LP
The Cmd directive applies to the preceding [Item] directive,
assigning \f(CRcommand\fR to the command property of the current menu
entry. The command executes when the menu entry is activated.
.IP "\(bu" 3
The [Cmd] directive may also affect multiple entries
when it follows a [Directory include] directive.
.IP "\(bu" 3
An empty \f(CRcommand\fR argument, or an [Item] without a [Cmd],
results in a dimmed menu entry that cannot be selected.
.LP
The \f(CRcommand\fR argument undergoes [Pathname expansion].
.IP "\(bu" 3
The argument itself may include pathnames. If these start with
\f(CR./\fR or \f(CR\(ti/\fR, they are also subject to [Pathname expansion], which
has notable implications (see ยง [Pathnames in shell commands]).
.IP "\(bu" 3
The argument may also include variable
references, which undergo [Variable expansion].
.SS
Pathnames in shell commands
.LP
Try out this important example:
.LP
.EX
    cd /tmp
    gtkmenuplus \(dqitem = test; cmd = dash -c 'echo Documents/. \(ti/Documents ./Documents'\(dq
.EE
.PP
Assuming \fIjoe\fR is you login name, activating the \(lqtest\(rq
menu item will print the following text to the terminal:
.LP
.EX
    Menu was deactivated.
    Run: dash -c 'echo \(ti/Documents ./Documents Documents/.'
    /home/joe/Documents /tmp/Documents Documents/.
.EE
.PP
Note that, unlike bash, the dash shell does not expand the leading
tilde; therefore gtkmenuplus did. Note also that the second output
path starts with \(lq/tmp/\(rq, and the last relative path is unchanged.
.SS
Command execution
.LP
Gtkmenuplus starts the given \f(CRcommand\fR, and does not wait
for its termination before closing the menu and exiting.
Command execution follows one of the following three methods:
.IP "\(bu" 3
[Shell-like execution]
.if n \
.sp -1
.if t \
.sp -0.25v
.IP "\(bu" 3
[MIME-type execution]
.if n \
.sp -1
.if t \
.sp -0.25v
.IP "\(bu" 3
[URI execution]
.SS
Shell-like Execution
.LP
In this method, Gtkmenuplus utilizes a Glib function[[sx1]] to launch the
command. This function implements only a subset[[sx2]] of the syntax available
in \f(CR/bin/sh\fR. While this subset is sufficient for executing simple commands,
more complex commands may require advanced shell features, such as filename
globbing, which are only provided by a real shell, such as \f(CR/bin/sh\fR. In such
cases, the \f(CRcommand\fR should invoke the shell directly using \f(CRsh -c\fR.
.PP
Examples:
.LP
.EX
    cmd = date

    cmd = /usr/bin/env date +%F

    cmd = sh -c 'set -- *.jpg; echo first JPG image: $1'

    cmd = sh -c 'set -- \(gafind *.png\(ga; echo $# PNG images found; echo $*'
.EE
.PP
\fBThe Command directive does not replace parameter references:\fR
.IP "\(bu" 3
References \f(CR$1\fR, \f(CR$2\fR, etc. are passed literally to
the underlying execution method that expands the \f(CRcommand\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 3
You can use a gtkmenuplus parameter inside the \f(CRcommand\fR via
an intermediate variable. For instance:
.LP
.EX
    # ex1 - parameter passed on the gtkmenuplus command line
    param_ = $1
    item   = run gtkmenuplus parameter \e\(dq$1\e\(dq
    cmd    = echo running \e\(dq$param_\e\(dq ...

    # ex2 - shell parameter passed directly to sh -c
    item   = run shell parameter \(dq1\(dq
    cmd    = sh -c 'echo running \e\(dq$1\e\(dq' A B
.EE
.IP
Save the first block above to file \(lqex1\(rq and the second one to \(lqex2\(rq.
Run \f(CRgtkmenuplus ex1 P\fR, select the item; the output is \(lqrunning P\(rq.
Run \f(CRgtkmenuplus ex2 P\fR, select the item; the output is \(lqrunning B\(rq.
.SS
MIME-type execution
.LP
In this method, the \f(CRcommand\fR argument is a path to a data file:
.LP
.EX
    cmd = data_file_path
.EE
.PP
Examples of data files include pictures, plain text files, word processor
documents, and more. These files can be executed as long as their MIME
type is associated with default applications[[mx1]] that can open them.
.SS
URI execution
.LP
In this method, the command is a URI:
.LP
.EX
    cmd = http://www.example.com
.EE
.PP
The URI is passed to the default application[[1ux]] that can open it.
In this case the application would typically be your web browser.
.SS
Tooltip
.LP
.EX
    tooltip = text
.EE
.LP
The Tooltip directive combines with a preceding [Item] directive
assigning \f(CRtext\fR to the tooltip property of the current menu entry.
.IP "\(bu" 3
The Tooltip directive may also affect multiple menu
entries if it follows a [Directory include] directive.
.SS
Icon
.LP
.EX
    icon = image_file_path | icon_name | \(dq\(dq
.EE
.LP
The Icon directive combines with a preceding [Item] directive
to assign an image to the icon property of the current menu entry.
.IP "\(bu" 3
The Icon directive may also affect multiple menu
entries if it follows a [Directory include] directive.
.LP
Note that, in its default configuration, gtkmenuplus tries to assign icons to
menu entries automatically, when possible. Hence, you only need to use the Icon
directive when gtkmenuplus cannot assign a menu entry icon on its own, or when
you want to use a different icon from the one the program has chosen.
.PP
Example of an automatic icon: \f(CRgtkmenuplus 'item = a; cmd = file.pdf'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 3
The menu will display a PDF file type icon.
.LP
Example of gtkmenuplus not being able to assign an icon:
\f(CRgtkmenuplus 'item = b; cmd = xdg-open file.pdf'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 3
The menu will not display an icon. Add an Icon directive to the
script, such as \f(CRicon = /path/to/pdf.png\fR, to fix the empty icon.
.LP
To hide an automatically-assigned icon, use an empty argument, literally
\(lq\f(CRicon=\fR\(rq. For bulk hiding, refer to ยง [Hiding item and submenu icons].
.SS
Image file path vs named icon
.LP
The \f(CRimage_file_path\fR argument undergoes [Pathname expansion] and [Directory
prefix exceptions]. The path must end with an image file extension from
the following set: \(lq.xpm\(rq, \(lq.png\(rq, \(lq.svg\(rq, \(lq.gif\(rq, \(lq.jpg\(rq, or \(lq.DirIcon\(rq.
Additionally, GTK must support opening the specified image type.
.PP
Instead of an image file path you can pass an icon name as the argument
of this directive. Named icons, such as \(lqleafpad\(rq or \(lqorg.gnome.Meld\(rq,
are looked up in the standard XDG icon directories[[ic1]]. GTK2 and GTK3
also provide stock icons, such as \(lqgtk-ok\(rq.
.SS
Invalid or omitted icon argument
.LP
If the [Configure]\f(CR=icons\fR option is enabled, and gtkmenuplus
cannot resolve the directive argument to an actual image, the
menu entry will not display an icon. A warning will be printed
only if the verbose (\f(CR-v\fR) command-line option is enabled.
.PP
Passing an empty argument will hide an automatically-assigned icon.
.SS
Hiding item and submenu icons
.LP
While a [Configure]=\f(CRnoicons\fR directive is active, gtkmenuplus disables
automatic icon assignment. Thus the [Item] and [Submenu] directives
will not display an icon unless an Icon directive explicitly sets one.
.PP
Automatic icons remain disabled until another
[Configure]\f(CR=icons\fR directive is encountered.
.IP "\(bu" 3
To hide [Launcher] icons refer to ยง [Hiding launcher icons].

Format section syntax
.LP
The \fIPango Text Attribute Markup Language\fR specification[pm1]
defines the syntax of a \f(CRformat_section\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 3
Gtkmenuplus only supports the \f(CR<span>\fR tag and its attributes. The
\(lqconvenience tags\(rq mentioned in the specification are not available.
.IP "\(bu" 3
For Pango Markup attributes whose names are composed of multiple
words, such as \f(CRfont-desc\fR, use hyphens (\f(CR-\fR) to separate the
components. For example, write \f(CRfont-desc\fR instead of \f(CRfont_desc\fR.
.LP
Syntax is validated directly by the underlying Pango Markup engine, which
reports invalid formats as GTK errors when the menu is \fIdisplayed\fR.
.PP
To disable markup processing altogether and display
\f(CR<span>\fR tags and other special characters such as \f(CR&\fR and
\f(CR<\fR literally, use the [Configure]\f(CR=nomarkup\fR directive.
.PP
Examples:
.LP
.EX
    format= font-desc=\(dqSans Italic 12\(dq       # it's \(gafont-desc', not \(gafont_desc'

Pango Markup can also be inlined. Refer to ยง [Inline span tag] for details.
.SS
Format mnemonic
.LP
.EX
    format = mnemonic=\(dqvalue\(dq
.EE
.LP
The [Format]\f(CR=mnemonic=\(dqvalue\(dq\fR directive modifies menu entry labels inserting
an underscore (\f(CR_\fR) into the label to mark a [Keyboard shortcut].
.IP "\(bu" 3
The mnemonic formatting is invalid inside an [Inline span tag],
and in combination with the [Tooltipformat] directive.
.IP "\(bu" 3
When mnemonic formatting is active, the Pango engine \fBdoes not\fR
recognize attribute names that include underscores. The solution is
to replace all underscores with hyphens within composite attribute
names, e.g., write \f(CRfont-desc\fR and not \f(CRfont_desc\fR.
.LP
The mnemonic \f(CR\(dqvalue\(dq\fR determines where to insert an underscore:
.IP "\(bu" 3
\f(CR\(dq1\(dq\fR inserts the mark before the first non-blank character
of the label, unless the label already includes an underscore.
.IP "\(bu" 3
A quoted string inserts \f(CR_<char>\fR before the label, ignoring whether the
label already includes an underscore. \f(CR<char>\fR is a character sequentially
extracted (with recycling) from the \f(CR\(dqvalue\(dq\fR string. Recycling restarts at
each submenu level.
.LP
Example:
.LP
.EX
    format = mnemonic=\(dq1\(dq

Launcher file
.LP
Some terminology is in order. The Desktop Entry specification[[la1]]
from freedesktop.org defines the structure and location[[la2]] of
desktop files, which generally describe, by means of \fIkey-value\fR pairs,
applications and how to start them.
.PP
These files are commonly named \(lqdesktop\(rq files because they use the
\f(CR.desktop\fR file name extension. Gtkmenuplus also and often refers to them
as \(lqlaunchers\(rq, and uses the term \(lqproperty\(rq to mean the \fIkey-value\fR pair.
.PP
The specification[[la1]] can also describe application collections, aptly
named \fIdirectories\fR, which are stored in \(lqdirectory\(rq files whose file name
extension is, you guessed, \f(CR.directory\fR. Gtkmenuplus often refers to these
files as \f(CRlauncher_dirfile\fRs. We will see them in ยง [Launcherdirfile].
.PP
Launcher and \f(CRlauncher_dirfile\fR files employ some of the same keys.
For instance, they can both contain the \(lqName\(rq key. The property that
distinguishes these two files is \(lqType=Application\(rq for launchers vs
\(lqType=Directory\(rq for \f(CRlauncher_dirfile\fRs.
.SS
Launcher paths

When gtkmenuplus reads a translated \f(CRName\fR or \f(CRComment\fR property that matches
the current system language, it uses the translated value for the menu entry
label or tooltip.
.PP
This functionality supports the development of multi-language menus composed
entirely of launcher files. These menus can be organized into submenus using the

File Include
.LP
.EX
include = script_file [parameter ...]
.EE
.LP
The \f(CRscript_file\fR argument undergoes [Pathname expansion]
and [Directory prefix exceptions].
.PP
The File Include directive inserts a sub-script into the current
script, reading the sub-script from the \f(CRscript_file\fR, and
setting [Parameters] from the optional \f(CRparameter\fR arguments.
.IP "\(bu" 3
The scope of the parameters is the included file.
.IP "\(bu" 3
Quote \f(CRparameter\fR to preserve white space.
.LP
Within the included file, relative pathnames are rebased to the
directory of the included file, see ยง [Directory prefix exceptions].
.PP
For backwards compatibility, it is still possible to use indentation
to make the contents of a script file appear as a submenu.
.IP "\(bu" 3
This mechanism is \fBdeprecated\fR and should not be used in new scripts.
.IP "\(bu" 3
Indent the [Include] directive as well as all the lines of the included
file just as if its contents were directly inside the including file.
.IP "\(bu" 3
Refer to ยง [Indentation and submenu nesting].
.LP
Pay attention not to recursively include a script file into
itself, directly or indirectly. This will result in a
console error message, and your menu will not be displayed.
.IP "\(bu" 3
The maximum include depth is 10, and this limit is enforced.
.LP
Parameters can be referenced as \f(CR$1\fR, \f(CR$2\fR, etc. anywhere in the
included script file. Refer to ยง [Parameter references] for details.
.PP
The following rules apply while the included file is being processed:
.IP "\(bu" 3
If the [Icondirectory]\f(CR=path\fR or [Launcherdirectory]\f(CR=path\fR
directives are active in the including file, their
paths remain in effect in the included file.
.IP "\(bu" 3
If the included file itself contains Icondirectory or Launcherdirectory
directives, their paths remain in effect only for the included
file and revert to previous path values when the inclusion ends.
.IP "\(bu" 3
If the included file contains the [Format] or [Tooltipformat]
directives, their scope can be restricted to the included
file by adding the [Configure]\f(CR=formattinglocal\fR option.
.SS
Directory Include
.LP
.EX
    include = directory_path[/file_glob] [directory_glob]
.EE
.LP
The \f(CRdirectory_path\fR argument undergoes [Pathname expansion]
and [Directory prefix exceptions].
.PP
The Directory Include directive scans the \f(CRdirectory_path\fR, creating menu
entries for readable files that match the extended glob \f(CRfile_glob\fR[[di1]].
.IP "\(bu" 3
If the glob is omitted, an \(lqany file\(rq glob (\f(CR*\fR) is implied; refer
to [[di2]] for extended globbing rules and examples.
.LP
When a file matches the glob, its name becomes the menu entry
label. Activating an entry attempts to launch its full pathname.
.PP
A non-empty \f(CRdirectory_glob\fR argument activates a recursive scanner that
generates submenu entries for directories, and leaf entries for files.
.IP "\(bu" 3
If \f(CRdirectory_glob\fR is omitted, the scanner considers only files directly
under \f(CRdirectory_path\fR. Otherwise the scanner recursively descends into
matching subdirectories, creating submenu entries for all encountered
directories and leaf entries for files matching \f(CRfile_glob\fR.
.LP
The scanner considers hidden files and directories and follows symbolic links
according to the \f(CRignorehidden\fR and \f(CRfollowsymlink\fR [Configure] directive
options. These options are evaluated for all files and directories encountered
during a scan. However, the initial arguments to the directive are processed
regardless of these options.
.IP "\(bu" 3
Scanning does not proceed past the maximum menu depth.[[sm1]]
.IP "\(bu" 3
The scanner discards empty submenus, and ignores unreadable directories.
.SS
Directory Include default icon, tooltip and command
.LP
The [Icon], [Tooltip], and [Cmd]\f(CR=command\fR directives can immediately
follow the Directory Include directive. In this case, the same icon and
tooltip apply to each menu entry, while \f(CRcommand\fR is prepended to each
scanned file path, forming the entry activation command.
.IP "\(bu" 3
If an Icon directive is not included, or it is empty, then gtkmenuplus
will look for the icon associated with the default program that can open
the matching file, and leave the entry icon empty if no such program exists.
.IP "\(bu" 3
Use \f(CRIcon=NULL\fR to hide the icon of included entries (see also [[la3]]).
.SS
Directory Include performance
.LP
If used unwisely, this directive can visit \fIa lot\fR of files on your hard disk,
therefore taking a long time to complete, and creating unwieldy menus that take enormous time to navigate. However, if used knowingly, the Directory Include directive, can create useful menus swiftly.
.PP
Here is a real example of how you should \fInot\fR use it:
.LP
.EX
gtkmenuplus -v 'configure=noicons; include=\(ti/.cache/thumbnails *'
[0] ok: no file input; assuming directives: configure=noicons; include=\(ti/.cache/thumbnails *
[0] ok: 76,381 ms to process the script
[0] ok: 316,763 ms to display the menu
[0] ok: menu items: 117681; submenus: 1; tracked entries 117682 (bytes: 612,887,856)
.EE
.PP
The \f(CRthumbnails/normal\fR directory holds some 117,000 PNG thumbnails. Gtkmenuplus
parsed and processed the directive in 76 seconds. Then GTK took 316 seconds
to display the menu. Overall, 6 minutes and a half elapsed from program start
before the menu could be navigated. However, navigating was impossible because
GTK took forever to show the next submenu, so much so that killing gtkmenuplus
from another session became necessary.
.SS
Include directive examples

.SS
Include directive errors
.LP
For backward compatibility, gtkmenuplus uses a slash to separate directory
paths from file globs. However, this design choice leads to ambiguity. For
instance, in the directive \f(CRinclude=/usr/lib/typo *\fR, gtkmenuplus cannot
determine if \(lqtypo\(rq is a mistyped directory name or the file glob \(lqtypo\(rq to
be looked for under \f(CR/usr/lib\fR. This ambiguity prevents gtkmenuplus from
reporting genuine typos as errors.
.SS
Absolute pathname
.LP
.EX
    [=] /path_to/file
     =  \(ti/path_to/file
     =  ./path_to/file
.EE
.LP
The Absolute pathname directive creates a menu entry from a pathname,
filling the [Menu entry properties] automatically. Properties cannot be
altered by explicitly adding the [Cmd], [Icon] and [Tooltip] directives.
.IP "\(bu" 3
If the pathname ends with \(lq.desktop\(rq and is a valid
[Launcher file], it is processed as a [Launcher] directive.
.LP
To enter an Absolute pathname directive start a line with an equal
sign (\f(CR=\fR) followed by \f(CR/\fR, \f(CR\(ti/\fR or \f(CR./\fR and the rest of the pathname.
.IP "\(bu" 3
The leading \f(CR=\fR can be omitted only if the pathname
starts with \f(CR/\fR and does not itself include \f(CR=\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 3
The leading \f(CR=\fR is required if the pathname is
constructed from variables, as in the following example:
.LP
.EX
    here == pwd
    = $pwd/file
.EE
.LP
By default, the menu entry label is the file name prefixed by its immediately
containing directory name, and the tooltip is the full pathname as read
before [Pathname expansion]. The label can be adjusted as follows.
.IP "\(bu" 3
If a [Configure]\f(CR=abspathparts N\fR option is active, the menu
label includes the last \f(CRN\fR pathname components (the name counts as
one component). If \f(CRN\fR is zero, the entire pathname is the label.
.LP
\fBExample: the configuration files in and under my home directory\fR

.SS
Relative pathname
.LP
.EX

.EE
.LP
A relative pathname can be a directive if it follows a leading equals sign.

The pathname follows similar processing to an [Absolute pathname] directive.
.PP
\fBExample: the configuration files in and under the current directory\fR

URI
.LP
.EX

.EE
.LP
A URI can be used as a directive when it follows a leading equals sign.
The leading \f(CR=\fR is required.
The menu entry label is the full URI string.
.IP "\(bu" 3
The \f(CRfile://\fR URI displays a menu icon.
It is activated similarly to an [Absolute pathname] directive.
.IP "\(bu" 3
Other URI schemes (\f(CRhttp\fR, \f(CRftp\fR, etc.) display a blank icon.
They are activated with the system\(cqs default application
associated with the scheme.
.SS
Submenu
.LP
.EX
    submenu = label
.EE
.LP
The Submenu directive begins a new menu entry and concludes the scope
of a preceding [Item] directive. It also ends the scope of a preceding
Submenu directive unless the [Configure]\f(CR=endsubmenu\fR option is enabled.
In that case, the submenu boundaries are determined using the deprecated
indentation mechanism (see below).
.IP "\(bu" 3
To select the submenu with a key-press set up a [Keyboard shortcut].
.LP
You can place [Icon] and [Tooltip] directives in any order immediately after
the Submenu directive to set the properties of the submenu entry. It is also
possible to conditionally set some properties using the [If] directive.
.PP
Empty submenus are discarded; their label will not be shown. To force displaying
the label of a submenu that has no contents, add an empty [Item] to the submenu.
.PP
See also ยง [Launchersubmenu].
.SS
Indentation and submenu nesting
.LP
The maximum menu depth is 5 levels (top menu and four submenu levels).[[sm1]]
.SS
Submenu indentation
.LP
For backwards compatibility, submenu boundaries are determined by line
indentation. Indent directives that belong to the submenu further than
the opening Submenu directive. The submenu ends just before the directive
that is indented at the same level as the opening Submenu.
.IP "\(bu" 3
This mechanism is \fBdeprecated\fR and should not be used in new scripts.
.LP
Newly-written menus should use [Configure]\f(CR=endsubmenu\fR option to enable the
[Endsubmenu] directive. Then, a submenu starts with its Submenu directive and
contains all directives until the first occurrence of an Endsubmenu directive,
regardless of indentation.
.PP
When deprecated indentation is used to delimit a submenu:
.IP "\(bu" 3
The directives comprising the body of the submenu, and
the submenu entry\(cqs [Icon] and [Tooltip] directives, must
be indented relative to the Submenu directive itself.
.IP "\(bu" 3
An indentation stop needs either \fIfour\fR spaces or a TAB character.
.IP "\(bu" 3
The current submenu ends with the first
directive having negative hanging indentation.
.IP "\(bu" 3
However, the indentation of directives that do not set [Menu entry
properties], such as [Iconsize], [Menuposition], [Icondirectory],
[If] and [Format] directives, does not affect the submenu structure.
.SS
Error
.LP
.EX
    error = message
.EE
.LP
The Error directive displays the \f(CRmessage\fR argument in a message
box, and reports the error to the standard error stream (see also

the menu will still be displayed.
.SS
Configure
.LP
.EX
    configure = option_name...
.EE
.LP
The Configure directive applies multiple configuration options that affect the

The Iconsize directive modifies the pixel dimensions of

.PP
Gtkmenuplus restricts the requested size to a range of 8 to 256 pixels. If
no Iconsize directive is active, the default size for GTK button icons is
used for menu icons, unless this default cannot be determined, in which case
a size of 32 pixels is applied. Not all sizes may be available; themed icon
bitmaps are typically installed in sizes of 16, 24, 48, and 96 pixels. If
the requested size is unavailable, the outcome depends on the GTK version:
GTK2 will scale bitmap icons to the requested size, while GTK3 will use the
closest installed size that is less than or equal to the requested size. SVG
icons can be resized to any requested size.

\fICases\fR determine the \fItruth value\fR, TRUE or FALSE, of the initial \f(CRexpression\fR:
.IP "\(bu" 3
FALSE (0) for cases \(lqfalse\(rq, \(lqno\(rq, \(lqoff\(rq, 0, and the empty string;
.IP "\(bu" 3
TRUE (1) for cases \(lqtrue\(rq, \(lqyes\(rq, \(lqon\(rq, and non-zero numbers;
.IP "\(bu" 3
INVALID (-1) otherwise.
.IP "\(bu" 3
Cases are matched irrespective of letter capitalization.
.LP
When the If condition is TRUE, directives in the if-body are evaluated,
while remaining directives up to the matching Endif are skipped.
.PP
When the If condition is not TRUE, directives in the if-body are skipped,
while remaining directives up to the matching Endif are evaluated.
.PP
The evaluation of an elseif-body follows the same rules as an if-body.
.SS
If scope
.LP
The scope of the If group of directives is the file in which they appear. When
an [Include] directive begins reading a new file, a new If scope is created.
.PP
Because the If, Elseif, Else and Endif directives \fIdo not\fR
end the scope of preceding [Item] or [Submenu] directives, it
becomes possible to create icons and tooltips conditionally.
.PP
Example:
.LP
.EX
    if= [ \(gadate +%H\(ga -le 18 ]; printf $?  # if past 6 PM
      item = evening game
      cmd = mahjongg
    else
     item = daytime game
     cmd = mines
    endif
    tooltip = this item depends on the current time

If compatibility
.LP
Before version 1.50.0, the behavior of directives within an If-Endif block
was inconsistent, questionable and poorly documented. For instance, some
older versions did not accept empty expressions, failed to report invalid
commands, and evaluate all conditional expressions within the block.
.PP
This implementation was corrected in version 1.50.0 as follows:
.IP "\(bu" 3
Empty expressions are now accepted and evaluate to FALSE.
.IP "\(bu" 3
Invalid commands are reported; however the shell still executes the command.
.IP "\(bu" 3
If the \f(CRexpression\fR of an If or Elseif directive is invalid, the
directives within its body are skipped through the closing Endif directive.
.IP "\(bu" 3
Evaluation of expressions stops after the
first TRUE value in an If-Endif block.

In XDG-compliant Desktop Environments (DE), the MIME-type icon is set by
the \f(CR.desktop\fR file of the default application. That is the highest-ranking
\f(CR.desktop\fR file whose \(lqMimeType=\(rq property includes the MIME-type of the data
file. Refer also the manual page for the \fIupdate\fRdesktop\fIdatabase(1)\fR command.

The canonical location of a desktop file is the \(lqapplication\(rq
directory under one of the parts of the \f(CRXDG_DATA_DIRS\fR and
\f(CRXDG_DATA_HOME\fR environment variables. For most systems these are
the \f(CR/usr/share/applications\fR, \f(CR/usr/local/share/applications\fR and
\f(CR\(ti/.local/share/applications\fR directories. Note that gtkmenuplus
can work with launchers located anywhere in the file system.
.SS

In a [Launcherdirfile], \(lqNULL\(rq is a reserved literal used to match launchers
with an omitted or empty \(lqCategories=\(rq property. This is only applicable when
the [Configure]\f(CR=nolaunchernullcategory\fR option is enabled. Note that this
\(lqNULL\(rq should not be confused with the special [Icon] name \f(CRNULL\fR.

Menu depth is capped at 5. This is a compile-time limit (\f(CRMAX_MENU_DEPTH\fR).
When the depth limit is reached:
.IP "\(bu" 3
The [Submenu] directive displays a fatal error
and exits the program without displaying the menu.
.IP "\(bu" 3
The [Directory Include] directive stops scanning the current
level, and continues in the parent directory. It does not report
an error; it displays a pruned menu.
.IP "\(bu" 3
The [Launchersub] directive stops scanning the current level, and continues
in the parent directory. It reports a warning; it displays a pruned menu.
