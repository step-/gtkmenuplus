     README (this file), usage.txt, INSTALL (how to install gtkmenuplus), COPYING, changelog

  test_menu.txt (an example menu configuration file read by gtkmenuplus)

  the source directory, containing: 
  
    gtkmenuplus.c common.c common.h launcher.c launcher.h menuInput.c menuInput.h
    the gtk2 directory containing a makefile to produce gtkmenuplus compiled with gtk+2
    the gtk3 directory containing a makefile to produce gtkmenuplus compiled with gtk+3, and the gtk+3 executable

  install.sh:   puts the executable gtkmenuplus into /usr/bin, and copies icon and desktop file.  Run with sudo or su.
  uninstall.sh: removes gtkmenuplus and icon.  Run with sudo or su.

  gtkmenuplus.svg: an icon that can be used in a launcher to start gtkmenuplus
