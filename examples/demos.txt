Most menus created by the following scripts use tooltips extensively, 
so have a look at what's there if you hover over menu items.

demoMenu1small.sh:               demonstrates use of format= to set font size and iconsize=
demoMenu2large.sh:               demonstrates use of format= to set font size and iconsize=
demoMenu3launchersAndInclude.sh: demonstrates use of launcher=, include= lines
demoMenu4ifVarsParams.sh:        demonstrates use of variables, if=/else/endif and parameters
demoMenu5subMenuKeyword.sh:      demonstrates use of endsubmenu instead of indentation 
demoMenu6caseChanger.sh:         demonstrates use of    

demoMenuAll.sh:                  runs all of the above demos in turn.

There are several miniature applications in subdirectories of the examples directory, 
each including a menu configuration file and supporting files, e.g. scripts and icons:

 The ubuntu_stop_modes directory: 
 
   A menu configuration file and icons to shutdown, reboot, suspend, and lock screen,

   Works for me on Ubuntu 11.10, but I can't find a command to cause hibernation on my machine.

   Quite probably won't work on other distros, maybe not even on other Ubuntu releases.

   It invokes xdg-screensaver, /usr/lib/indicator-session/gtk-logout-helper, gnome-screensaver-command, and pmi.

   To make sure you have all those, do

     sudo apt-get install powermangement-interface xdg-utils gnome-screensaver indicator-session

   It includes a demonstration of a menu choice (suspend) running multiple commands via bash.

   To run, Assign a keyboard shortcut or launcher to

      gtkmenuplus path_to/ubuntu_stop_modes


 The case_changer directory: 
 
   A menu configuration file and script invoked by it to change case of text in editable controls.

   The script requires sed, tr, xclip and xdotool, the latter two of which you'll have to fetch from repositories.
   Also invokes zenity (if installed) for error messages, so you could fetch that too.

     sudo apt-get install xclip xdotool zenity

   Put caseChanger.sh in a directory on your path (typically $HOME/bin);
   Put the menu configuration file (clip_menu) anywhere.  Assign a keyboard
   shortcut to

     gtkmenuplus path_to/clip_menu

   Highlight text in any editable control.
   Make sure the window containing that control has focus.
   Hit the shortcut key, choose an option on the popup menu.

   As a special case, if you have a file selected in nautilus same script should work.
   If you want to make the same feature work for another file manager, you'll have to edit
   caseChanger.sh at at least three points (all commented).


 The manpage_menu directory: 
 
  A set of scripts (using gtkmenuplus and/or myGtkMenu, and other programmes)
  to display a menu of man pages and display your choice of one (as text, html, a pdf, in yelp or
  in man in a terminal.  Run manpageMenu.sh, with the other scripts in the same directory.

  Includes a menu configuration file, manpagesSpecific, which presents a menu
  of man pages.  It invokes the script manpageDisplay.sh which should be on your path,
  as should manpageCommon.sh.
  
  manpagesSpecific (invoked either on the gtkmenuplus command line or in an include= line)
  must be followed by a parameter indicating the display you with (pdf, text, html, man)

  manpage.png might be a useful icon for a submenu containing include=manpagesSpecific,
  or a launcher for Run manpageMenu.sh

  The man pages named in manpagesSpecific cmd= lines may not exist on your system
  if you haven't installed the programmes in question.  Each item is surrounded by
  if=/endif lines so the item won't appear if you don't have the programme.
