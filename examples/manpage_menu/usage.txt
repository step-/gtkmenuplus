manPagesMenu.sh

manPagesMenu is a collection of scripts allowing you to find man pages via a gui, 
and display them in a variety of ways.

Place manPagesMenu.sh, displayManPage.sh and manPagesFunctions.sh in the same folder.  
They don't have to be on the path.

Create a launcher to manPagesMenu.sh anywhere, or run from gtkmenuplus or myGtkMenu, 
or add to main menu, or run from command line.  

manPagesMenu uses yad or zenity to present search options.  
yad is preferable, and used if installed.  
See INSTALL on how to get it.

manPagesMenu uses gtkmenuplus, myGtkMenu, yad, zenity or pdmenu to display a list of 
man pages matching your search criteria. For large numbers (thousands) of results 
gtkmenuplus, myGtkMenu and pdmenu are faster than yad or zenity.

myGtkMenu is limited to 2000 results; manPagesMenu will exit if you've chosen myGtkMenu to display
results and there are too many of them.

manPagesMenu displays your chosen man page in yelp, (the GNOME Help Browser); as an html page;
as a pdf; or as a man page in a terminal.  Display as html will use man2html urls if it's installed, 
otherwise will use the man --html=<your default brownser> option; 
display as a pdf requires ps2pdf.  If the relevant packages aren't installed, 
the yad search options dialog won't offer html or pdf as display options.


about 4000 items:
using gtkmenuplus, with pipe:    2 min 20 sec  
using gtkmenuplus, without pipe: 2 min 08 sec  
using yad:                       1 min 50 sec  
using zenity:                    1 min 30 sec  
using pdmenu:                    1 min 38 sec  
using myGtkMenu:                 1 min 33 sec (but stops half way through (2000 menu item count exceeded)
