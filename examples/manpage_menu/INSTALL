You need to set a few constants in manPagesMenu.sh

set your preferred terminal application; replace '' with your application:
alter the line:

readonly TERMINAL_PROG=gnome-terminal # or maybe xterm, terminator

If you don't have yad, or want to display a different default section for yad dialog, set

nSection=1

The script uses zenity or yad to construct dialogs. zenity is probably in your default repositories.
yad is zenity on steroids and is preferred: you can get it via the varias ppas

  http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/package/webupd8/precise/main/base/yad
  
or from

nProgChooseWith relates to the programme used to display a list of man pages.
If you have yad it determines $PROG_EXISTS programme is the default offered in the yad gui.
If you don't have yad it determined $PROG_EXISTS programme s used.
gtkmenuplus and myGtkMenu are faster to list large numbers of manpages than yad or zenity.
